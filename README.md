# Expandable Section Demo

Demo of using a table view with sticky section headers where the top section header (actually a custom view) also remains sticky. Also demonstrates using a custom segmented control ([HMSegmentedControl](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl "HMSegmentedControl")) and dynamically hiding it while in search.

using segmented control to display Selected and All items in a list.
